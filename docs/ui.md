# UI

Cliiippo has three surfaces: the clipboard palette, Settings/About, and the single-page onboarding
window. Shared spacing, color, typography, radius, and sizing values live in `Theme.swift`.

The app icon is intentionally flat and minimal: a cream clipboard with three offset sheets on a
muted charcoal field and one coral accent. It does not reuse Tinycast's visual language.

Use the existing custom dialog and popover primitives. Keep the palette keyboard-first, readable at
small sizes, and usable in both light and dark appearances.
